LET’S PLAY! WAIT… HOW?

Version (i)


Hide and seek is a tricky common children’s game among all communities living in Kenya.
 It is both an indoor and outdoor game played by at least four children whether male (boys) or female (girls). 
In this game, one child will be asked to close his/her eyes or be hoodwinked with a piece of cloth so that the rest will run and hide in secret places. 
After few minutes the seeker will open the eyes or untie the cloth and start to seek others who are now securely hidden. 
In this classic version of the game, an object (a chair, bell or tin) is placed in the centre of the playing ground. If the seeker discovers the hiding place of one child, he runs to the object and hits it. 
The one who was discovered first becomes the seeker in the next round of game. 
And if all the hiders hit the object before the seeker reveals them, he remains to be the seeker. 

Version ii

In another version of this traditional game, players hide in an area while one person (seeker) counts from one to one hundred (usually loudly in units of five or ten: "five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty, forty-five, fifty, fifty-five, sixty, sixty-five seventy, seventy-five, eighty, eighty-five, ninety, ninety-five, one hundred or ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred) with his back turned from hidden players then turns round and begins to find them. 

When the hidden group is ready, one of them says ‘brikicho’ and the others respond ‘bantura’. In other words, the seeker would say: ‘Here I come, ready or not" and the others would respond, ‘ready’ or ‘not ready’.

This is a versatile game that can be adapted to different age groups, varying levels of physical ability and a range of environments and is enjoyed internationally due to its simple concept and unlimited recreational appeal.

Version iii
SAVE US ALL
The games introduction is similar to the first version.

The only twist happens after a the child hiding is discoverEd. 
These two compete. Whoever taps the object at the middle first wins.

What if the person hiding taps it first?
If a person hiding taps first, the person has a  chance to hide again.

What then?
Anyone whose hiding place had been found out hides again too. Cool, right?
